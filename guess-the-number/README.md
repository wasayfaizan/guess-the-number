Project Title:
Guess That Number


Project Description:

The app is a type of guessing game. In particular, it will randomly choose a positive integer between 1 and 30. Then it will ask the user to not only guess the number it selected but also the number of attempts it will take to guess the number correctly. If the user guesses the number right within the given number of tries, first the app will congratulate them. Secondly, it will ask the user for their name, which will then be displayed on a winner’s list shortly after. If the user exceeds the number of tries proposed, the app will display a message stating that the user has lost, as well as the correct answer. Further, the game will reset and the user can play again if they wish. 

To make the app more intricate there will be a couple of more game modes that the player has the option of choosing from besides the default one. Such as there is a timed mode in which a player has a limited amount of time to choose and must be fast on his feet to get the highest score possible, a mode in which the player starts with a few attempts which increase as long as the player keeps getting it right, or an endless mode that lets you play the game without worry of getting it right or not (game modes will not affect leaderboard status only the default mode will change your ranking). 

UI description:
The main screen will contain the name of the game centered at the top and below it would be the different modes all centered below each other with their own buttons to play for each of them. Then each of the different modes will have their own set of interfaces to match according to their requirements.  

Functional Requirements: 
- The system gives a pop-up on the instructions of the game.
- The system must allow a player to input the number of attempts they'd like to guess the number correctly.
- The system must allow a player to continue guessing until they have exceeded the given number of attempts.
- The system requires user to only enter numbers otherwise entry is invalid.
- The system must allow a player to exit the game. (exit button available while in game).
- The system must ask for the player to input their name (to add to the leaderboard) if the game is won. 
- The system must randomly select a positive integer between 1 and 30 and conceal it until the game either won or lost. 
- The system congratulates player for taking number 1 spot on leaderboard.
- The user can view the leaderboard before starting their game.
- The system prompts user with a “failure” message if they do not guess the correct number.
- The system prompts user with a “congrats” message if they do guess the correct number.
- The system gives users the option to change the theme of the app (light mode, dark mode, etc.).Option to change theme in main menu.
- The system gives an option to play again or return to home screen
