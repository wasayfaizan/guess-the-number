Algorithm guessThatNumber(attempts, guess)
Pre-conditions: both variables are integer value; number of attempts should not exceed __, and guessed values must be between 1 and 30
Post-conditions: "Congratulations, you won!" is outputted if guess is the same as the answer, and "Sorry, you lose." is outputted if the number of attempts is exceeded.
   Input 2 integer values
   Output string value

   answer <- random integer between 1 & 30 is assigned
   //i <- 0

   for i to attempts-1 do
      if guess = answer then
         output <- "Congratulations, you won!"
      else if i = attempts then
         output <- "Sorry, you lose."   
      else
         print "Incorrect. Try again!"
         guess <- new input (integer value) is assigned 
         //i <- i + 1

   return output
      


Algorithm chancesRemaining(attempts)
Pre-conditions: input is an integer value; number of attempts should not exceed __
Post-conditions: Number of attempts remaining after each try is returned
   Input 1 integer value
   Output 1 integer value
   
   //i <- 0

   for i to attempts-1 do
      remainingAttempts <- attempts
      return remainingAttempts
      remainingAttempts <- remainingAttempts - 1
      //i <- i + 1
